## Summary
<!-- Though modest, this was my first game in pure JavaScript, HTML & CSS, and the process meant gaining a handle on the Math object. As a little girl, I remember playing my first computer games in the 90s and being in awe, wondering how the computer was able to make random selections on its own, so solving this old mystery from my past was both charming and even a bit heartwarming. I was also able to strengthen my "event-handler muscle", a function which continuous to present itself in my JavaScript projects. I used to feel that projects like these were too boring or basic, but I'm so glad I ended up doing them as the experience has been humbling, and I've consequently learnt to appreciate all there is to gain from them. Excited to take on the next programming challenge!     -->
